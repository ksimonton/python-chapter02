# Katelyn Simonton - Python Chapter 2 Exercise 4

# Exercise 4: Please copy the link to your program and attach it for turn in. Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

# width//2

# width/2.0

# height/3

# 1 + 2 \* 5

# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

width = 17
height = 12
	
print(width//2)
type(width//2)
print(width/2)
type(width/2)
print(height/3)
type(height/3)
