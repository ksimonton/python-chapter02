# Katelyn Simonton - Python Chapter 02 - Exercise 03

# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.

# Enter Hours: 35
# Enter Rate: 2.75
# Pay: 96.25
# We won't worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.

hours = int(input("Enter Hours: "))
rate= float(input("Enter Rate: "))
pay = float(int(hours *rate))
print ("Pay: " + str(pay))
